# USER GUIDE

## Dashboard (homepage)

This page can be accessed any time by tapping or clicking the App Title in the upper left corner of the app, in the banner.

The red/green color gradient shows the proportion of over to under bets.

The black bar is the relative size of the pot. For active betting pools, it is relative to all active pots. For closed (historical) pools, it's relative to the total of all closed pools.

The star indicates whether you have a bet placed on this pool. If you do, your bet will be be displayed beside the star.

Closed (resolved) pools are displayed in the bottom of the list, in faded colors. They have been paid out, and if you had a bet on them, your net winnings or loss will be displayed along with an indicator to show whether you won or lost.

Tap on any betting pool to enter the betting view.

## Betting page

The bars on the right side illustrate the current bets on this pool and their relative size. Drag your finger or mouse over them to view the value and better for each.

When you start to make a bet, you will see an orange preview bar that shows the size of the bet. If you have a bet already, yours will be highlighted in orange. 

You may increase an existing bet, but you cannot decrease it, or bet on the other side.

Your current funds will be shown in the upper right corner.

When you bet, you are betting directly against the other side. You stand to win the gems of anyone who has bet the other side, divided up between everyone who bet your side, proportionately. This is visually represented by the bars on the right side, and more info is given in the preview when you are making your bet.

#### Examples

- There are 10 gems on the Under, and 0 on the Over. You bet 1 gem on the over. If you win, you will get your 1 gem back and all 10 gems from the other side, for a total of 11.

- There are 10 gems on the Under, and 0 on the Over. You bet 1 gem on the over. Your friend sees the great odds and also bets 1 gem on the Over. If you win, you will get your 1 gem back plus 5 gems from the other side, for a total of 6.

- There are 30 gems on the Under, and 0 on the Over. You bet 1 gem on the over. Your friend sees the great odds and also bets 2 gems on the Over. If you win, you will get your 1 gem back and 10 gems from the other side, for a total of 11. Your friend will get 21, because they bet more. 

All gems will be automatically credited to your account when the pool resolves and is closed.

If you run out of gems, the bank will top you up with 5 automatically after some time, so you can start betting again and build up funds! The delay is variable and subject to change for accounts that attempt to abuse this feature, but will always be long enough that you can't just cheese it.
